      <p class="about-me">Hello, My name is Kevin Valentino. I see myself as an open-minded individual with strong teamwork skills and a diligent work ethic. These qualities make it easy for me to connect with people around me in a new work environment. As a young programmer, I have completed various projects both during my college years or outside it.

I acknowledge my points and i am dedicating myself to keep improving so i am looking for opportunities to broaden my knowledge and abilities in order to bring positive impact for those around me.</p>
